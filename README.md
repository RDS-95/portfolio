In this repo, I have included some personal projects (large and small).

# DiceGameStrategy

This is a notebook inspired by an interview question I once received. It contains a thorough analysis of a theoretical dice game.

# GANs-MScThesis-SampleNotebook.pdf

This is a sample jupyter notebook showing some of the work done on my MSc. Thesis project. It relates, in particular, to section 5.1 in the PDF file. The complete project can also be found in this directory for more context and detail.

# GANs-MScThesis.pdf

A copy of my research thesis (received 92%). Submitted as part of a Master of Science degree in Financial and Computational Mathematics at University College Cork. 

Abstract:

Asset price returns possess several properties that, when combined, make their modelling difficult.
Through our analysis of these properties and review of past approaches, we introduce a new solution - a
convolution-based generative adversarial network (GAN) with fewer layers than comparable models in the
current literature. Our GAN can successfully replicate the distributional traits of traditional financial
models and of real-world financial time series data. Additionally, we showcase the modelâ€™s ability to
extend into a conditional framework for generating time series under specific conditions.

# NLP - Bumble reviews.ipynb

A quick sentiment analysis piece based on dating app reviews. The data set comes from Kaggle.

# Shakespeare_RNN.ipynb

A demonstration of a stateless RNN trained on Shakespearean text and then used to generate dialogue probabilistically.
