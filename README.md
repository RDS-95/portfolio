# Rudy's Portfolio

In this repo, I have included some personal projects (large and small).

#### GANs_TimeSeries_MSc

A copy of my research thesis (received 90%). Data-driven asset price modelling. I developed novel generative neural network models in TensorFlow for derivative pricing applications. I submitted this thesis as part of a Master of Science degree in Financial and Computational Mathematics at University College Cork. It also includes a sample Jupyter notebook, showing methods used.

#### Option Parity

This folder contains a class I created to visualise payoffs for complex options positions and an experiment building GUIs in Python. I have included a Jupyter notebook to demonstrate the intended functionality.

#### DiceGameStrategy

This file is a notebook inspired by an interview question I once received. It contains a thorough analysis of a theoretical dice game.

#### NLP - Bumble reviews.ipynb

This notebook is a quick sentiment analysis piece based on dating app reviews. The data set comes from Kaggle.
