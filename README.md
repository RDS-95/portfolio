A copy of my research thesis (received 92%). Submitted as part of a Master of Science degree in Financial and Computational Mathematics at University College Cork. 

Abstract:

Asset price returns possess several properties that, when combined, make their modelling difficult.
Through our analysis of these properties and review of past approaches, we introduce a new solution - a
convolution-based generative adversarial network (GAN) with fewer layers than comparable models in the
current literature. Our GAN can successfully replicate the distributional traits of traditional financial
models and of real-world financial time series data. Additionally, we showcase the model’s ability to
extend into a conditional framework for generating time series under specific conditions.
